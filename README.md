# TTC-Replicated-Display
A JavaFX based application that replicated the TTC Display used in the new Hybrid Nova Buses. 

## How to checkout codebase and run it via Development? 
#### Step 1
You must have the latest version of Eclipse installed. You can download it 
[here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

#### Step 2
Open the project in eclipse by clicking *Open projects from File System*. 

#### Step 3
Once in the main screen, click on *Directory* and select the project folder from where you pulled it/downloaded 
from. 

#### Step 4

## How do I run the program normally?

Download the Runnable Jar File *TTCSignage.jar*, located in __Final Product__. Then, just double-click the jar 
file like you would for any normal program.

** This is just a fun program I made because I love buses and coding. Feel free to give me any feedback on this 
as I am always looking to improve and learn more. Have fun and Enjoy! :) **
